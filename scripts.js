She literally won a Grammy for a song she wrote as a teenager... in under an hour. Don't worry the song still holds up, along with the rest of the Album. Fiona Apple was a staple of the late 90's, she was often found on the various sets of Paul Thomas Anderson or wearing angel wings on stage."

After the Jon Brion leaks the album was completely redone with another producer. Fiona Has criticized this album for the inclusion of 'bs' filler songs that she was forced to create under the terms of her contract. That being said this album brought Fiona Apple into the 2000s, with a new more mature sound and her writing sharp as ever."

Moving away from the piano backed ballads that marked the begginning of her career Fiona began experimenting with percussion. This album is so different from her debut album that you might make the mistake of thinking they are by two different artists. The change in music driven by maturity and life experience continues to showcase her phenominal writing ability as well as her knack for using instruments when words dont't cut it. With lyrics like 'I ran out of white dove feathers to soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth everytime you address me' and 'My heart's made of parts of all that surround me and that's why the devil just can't get around me.' it is easy to see Fiona is a once in a lifetime artist."

Fiona proved herself a poet and possibly a prophet. In all seriousness this Album took the world by storm, earning the first PitchFork 10/10 rating in over a decade (mind you, Kanye West, the last recepient of this review stated his admiration of Fiona Apple and her Writing ability and her impressive lexicon). Fiona Apple scored 2 Grammy's with this Album, skipped the Grammy's (Never forget the ostracized her at 19) and proceeds to live a quiet life out of the spotlight. She appears to her fans through a single fan account/archive and her roommate, Zelda, who recently reported Fiona is writing new music and feeling very inspired. She spends her days walking her dog Mercy, staying diligent in Court Watcher volunteer groups, occaisionally going online to discuss her latest obsession (most notably the time she spoke at length on her love of slugs) and one day maybe this year or five years from now she will release another stunning album that moves all it's listeners."
