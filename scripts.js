She literally won a Grammy for a song she wrote as a teenager... in under an hour. Don't worry the song still holds up, along with the rest of the Album. Fiona Apple was a staple of the late 90's, she was often found on the various sets of Paul Thomas Anderson or wearing angel wings on stage."

After the Jon Brion leaks the album was completely redone with another producer. Fiona Has criticized this album for the inclusion of 'bs' filler songs that she was forced to create under the terms of her contract. That being said this album brought Fiona Apple into the 2000s, with a new more mature sound and her writing sharp as ever."
